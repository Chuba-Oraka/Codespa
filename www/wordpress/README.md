# CodespaOnWordpress
Based on the [wordpress-download-new-travis](https://github.com/ChubaOraka/Codespa/tree/wordpress-download-new-travis) branch of my [ChubaOraka/Codespa](https://github.com/ChubaOraka/Codespa/] repo. This is the only branch that seems to do what I need it to do -- display the website. However, I have still not been able to deploy to heroku. What has worked is deploying the site using WAMP server \(on a Windows machine\). Another alternative is using a XAMP server.
